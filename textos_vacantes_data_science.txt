We are looking for a junior data scientist to join The Wall Street Journal’s membership analytics team. The Wall Street Journal’s mission is to present factual, fair information that offers both nuance and balance to readers—we believe markets, economics, and business are the forces that animate our world, the jobs we have, and the products we buy. Our membership analytics team is committed to supporting great business journalism through the improvement of our products and the growth of our subscription business.
We obsess over building best-in-class data products, that bring applied research methods to all stages of the customer lifecycle. This includes developing innovative modeling approaches to inform product decisions and member engagement strategies.

You will assist in the management and execution of large scale data projects and support daily reporting on both our business and our journalism.
What you’ll do:
Source and query data required for both ongoing business intelligence efforts and larger scale data science projects.
Draw meaningful insights from large datasets—find creative ways those insights can be used to both sell subscriptions and make the experience of reading The Wall Street Journal better.
Assist in the management of long-term data projects. Effectively communicate with business, product, and newsroom stakeholders, identifying requirements and developing success metrics for the development and deployment of machine learning applications.
Use visualization tools to present complex data in a simple, engaging manner.
Identify opportunities for new data projects. Ask smart questions, diagnose the real problem, and develop a long-term solution.
Requirements:
You have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information systems, mathematics, statistics, or a related quantitative discipline. Applicants with some data-related expertise and a professional background in media are also encouraged to apply.
1-2 years professional experience at a media company is preferred. An enthusiasm for The Wall Street Journal and an understanding of the product is a must.
You have an entrepreneurial attitude toward work and sweat the details.
You have experience using analytics tools (SQL, Tableau, Excel) and an interest in more advanced topics in analytics (machine learning, artificial intelligence).
Coding skills (i.e. R, Python) and experience in building web applications is a plus.

Junior Data EngineerWarby Parker37 reviews-New York, NYWarby Parker37 reviewsRead what people are saying about working here.Warby Parker is looking for a motivated Junior Data Engineer to join our growing Technology team. In this role, you'll build out and maintain our data processing platform and reporting models used in key financial and accounting systems analysis. Working closely with the Financial Planning and Accounting teams, as well as the Supply Chain team, you'll build and support critical data products that enable our company to grow and improve. If this sounds like the kind of work you'd thrive on, we'd love to hear from you!
What you'll do and what you'll learn:
Our Technology team uses a mix of experience and objective data analysis to constantly experiment and iterate. You'll practice this method alongside other experienced Data Engineers as you take technical ownership of the system that powers Warby Parker's understanding of accounting and inventory data.

Our team is about as collaborative and transparent as they come, so you'll also participate in code reviews to maintain high quality of code. (We're building our systems to last and to adapt!). Primarily, you'll use Python and SQL and you'll learn how to deploy your code continuously using Git. We are a cloud-native company and work with many cloud products (IaaS and SaaS) offered by Amazon Web Services. Using these services, you'll apply techniques that are scalable and help our tech-enabled business to focus on delivering value.

As a Junior Data Engineer, you'll collaborate with software engineers and analysts on the Accounting and Supply Chain teams to understand their needs, produce code to solve their reporting problems, and provide business intelligence in Looker. You'll learn how to model data with a high degree of accuracy that can be used by the Accounting teams. In time, you'll increase model intelligibility and improve data processing efficiency. You'll also support the Financial Accounting teams with audit activities, regular period-based analysis and closing activities, and new exploratory opportunities.
Who you are:A thoughtful, detail-oriented engineer who has worked with data for at least one year professionally
Backed by working experience with (or a thorough understanding of) accounting and inventory systems—or experience with corporate finance, planning, and analysis solutions
Well-versed in SQL and Python
Familiar with open-source ETL tools like Airflow, Luigi, or Talend, or with commercial systems like Informatica, SSIS, or DataStage
Experienced working on a major relational database management system—PostgreSQL (which we use), Oracle, or MySQL—and optimizing queries
Able to describe how a transactional data model is different from a reporting and analytics data model
An excellent communicator, especially when it comes to explaining technical approaches and solutions to business-oriented stakeholders
About us:Warby Parker was founded in 2010 with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in house, we're able to offer insanely high-quality eyewear at decidedly non-insane prices (i.e., from $95 with prescription lenses—a fraction of the going price!).

In the last eight years, we've grown to over 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, opened our first optical lab in upstate New York, and launched two of our own iOS apps. And for three years running, Fast Company has named us one of the world's most innovative companies.

We also hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. This means lots of different things, like operating carbon-neutrally and distributing a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair we sell. (We're big believers that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world.)

Of course, all work and no play makes an extremely dull office, and no one likes an extremely dull office. (We sure don't.) As an employee at Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, guest speakers, volunteering opportunities, and other brain- (and/or taste-bud-) stimulating activities. It also doesn't hurt that our team is just great company.
Some benefits and perks of working at Warby Parker:Health, vision, and dental insurance
Flexible "My Time" vacation policy
Retirement savings plan with a company match
Parental leave (non-birthing parents included)
Cell phone plan reimbursement
A health-and-wellness stipend
Free eyewear (plus discounts for friends and family)
And more (just ask!)

Data Scientist - You Make Data SingNT Concepts37 reviews-Vienna, VANT Concepts37 reviewsRead what people are saying about working here.Overview
Who We Are
NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It’s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you’ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.
We’re probably a little more Valley than Beltway. Culture first. Service oriented, non-hierarchical, focused on the work, and less about process/ dress codes/ etc. We believe in giving back, too. For example, our founder leads a company trip every year to the Dominican Republic to build homes as part of Homes of Hope.
Responsibilities
Why We’re Both Here - The Work at Hand
One of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You’ll be an expert for clients, partnering closely with our team of Developers and Data Engineers to create robust machine learning solutions. You’ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, provide guidance on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise. We mostly focus on exploiting geospatial data of all types (because pictures and maps are fun!) with a sprinkling of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ve also got some really cool technology partners that add tools to your toolkit.
We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
Qualifications
Who You Are
Beyond the whole “this person is awesome and I love working with them” piece, there are a few core skills that will help you out here.
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data.
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics. We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets.NT Concepts - 30+ days ago - save job - original jobApply NowApply On Company SiteSave this jobOther jobs you may likeData ScientistTechFlowReston, VA 20190Easily apply8 days agoSr. Machine Learning Dev.Request TechnologyReston, VA$100,000 - $130,000 a yearRequest Technology-8 days agoData ScientistClayton SearchTysons Corner, VAEasily apply12 days agoData ScientistCleverTerraVienna, VAEasily apply19 hours agoData ScientistBlue Compass, LLCSpringfield, VA$110,000 - $150,000 a yearEasily apply7 days agoSee more recommended jobsData Scientist jobs in Vienna, VAJobs at NT Concepts in Vienna, VAData Scientist salaries in Vienna, VA

Applied Scientist - Personalization Data SciencesAmazon.com26,330 reviews-Seattle, WAAmazon.com26,330 reviewsRead what people are saying about working here.Job Description
Amazon's Personalization team owns recommending items to millions of customers, personalizing the Amazon.com website based on each customer's unique interests. We revolutionized e-commerce with features such as "Customers Who Bought This Also Bought" and "Recommended for You," and we continue to be at the forefront of innovation in this space. We rely heavily on experimentation for learning how best to serve our customers: when we launch something new, how do we know it's actually effective and makes the customer experience better, not worse? Developing evaluation techniques is just as important as the algorithmic development itself because otherwise we're flying blind.
The Personalization Analytics team is seeking a skilled and creative applied scientist to help us build the future of experimentation systems at Amazon.
About you:
You have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to make a big impact on Amazon and its customers. You enjoy enabling intelligent decisions in the face of real-world, noisy data, and have a bias for delivering simple solutions to complex problems. You're a scientist looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You're a thought leader and you demonstrate this by delivering solutions, not just by having ideas. You challenge yourself and others to come up with better solutions. You develop strong working relationships and thrive in a collaborative and friendly team environment.
About us together:
We're going to help Amazon innovate faster and smarter by designing and delivering the next generation of data analysis tools and visualizations. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly insurmountable challenges. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is better than each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.
We have decades of combined experience on the team in many areas of data science so it's a great environment in which to learn and grow. Many of us have university teaching experience and we're happy to teach. But, we're also like children playing at the edge of a vast unexplored territory; we have a lot to learn and we are all exploring together with a sense of awe and humility.Basic Qualifications
Advanced degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, or Machine Learning.Computer Science fundamentals in algorithm design, problem solving, and complexity analysis.Proficiency in at least one modern programming language such as Python or C/C++.Preferred Qualifications

Delivery - Engagements include on-site projects proving the use of ML, AI, and data analytic services to support information security in the cloud. Engagements will include migration of existing applications, evolution of existing capabilities and process, and development of new applications using AWS cloud services.
Practice Development – Helping customers is our number one goal – but it’s not our only goal. With each engagement, you’re looking for ways to collect, capture, package and share your knowledge with new customers, partners, and AWS employees. You are a force-multiplier – developing tools, services, and new artifacts to help others build on the work you deliver.

Data ScientistTransfix.io-New York, NYTransfix is changing the way companies view their supply chain. We are an award winning, recognized market and technology leader in the full truckload (FTL) market, which is a $420 billion market each year in the U.S. alone. We eliminate waste and solve inefficiencies through a deep understanding of the dynamics that exist today for the world's leading shippers and the millions of carriers and drivers that move their goods. We identify blind spots where data can fundamentally transform the way shippers and carriers work together, and we reduce the amount of “empty miles” driven by truckers with algorithms that match freight with trucks based on location in realtime. Our solution yields significant savings for shippers and increased pay for truck drivers. Ultimately, our mission is simple: to improve the lives of both shippers and carriers by creating a more efficient, transparent platform by which a product can be moved from anywhere to everywhere at anytime.
The problems we solve everyday are real and require creativity, grit, and determination. The culture we're building is one where we challenge the norms of the industry. The team we have is built on the foundation of personal growth, collaboration and experimentation.
Launched in August 2013, we have raised $78.5M in capital and are backed by top VC firms in NYC and San Francisco including, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Canvas Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Corigin Ventures, Founder Collective and Bowery Capital. We are headquartered in New York City.
As a Transfix Data Scientist, you will implement machine learning models into critical business processes, forecast industry trends, and build data pipelines. The Data Science team works closely with engineers, pricing analysts, and the business intelligence team to complement qualitative knowledge of the freight industry with rigor and quantitative insights. We’re currently living in AWS infrastructure including SageMaker and Redshift. At Transfix, you will be expected to autonomously run your own projects, drive business impact, and be a domain expert for teams across the company.
What you'll do:
Develop and implement pricing strategies into our automated bidding processes
Build forecasting models for freight market pricing changes using industry indicators
Collaborate with our Sales, Operations, and Tech teams to provide analytic and machine learning support
Execute long-term modeling initiatives
Drive adoption of improved, innovative technologies and tools

Develop methodology and prototype features in our internal experimentation platform to identify and capture novelty effects in experiments
Investigate the effect of how “satisfying” a question page is on user engagement and clickthrough patterns through the rest of the product
Understand effects of positional bias on home feed ranking to identify opportunities to improve ranking and feed engagement
Improve the accuracy of a user engagement prediction model and understand what factors are important in determining new users' long term usage.

Who we're looking for:
We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a pet person.

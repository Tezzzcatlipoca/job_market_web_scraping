Use visualization tools to present complex data in a simple, engaging manner.

We are PepsiCo
PepsiCo is a global food and beverage leader operating in more than 200 countries with a product portfolio that includes 22 world-famous, billion-dollar brands. From Gatorade to Quaker, to LIFEWTR, to Lay’s, we make hundreds of enjoyable foods and beverages that are loved throughout the world.

Innovation is a critical way we impact the market, as well as communities around the globe. We believe there is value in products, people, and planet. And we strive to make a difference by creating solutions that leave a lasting positive footprint.

Our culture is driven by our employees. No two days are the same; we’re dynamic and full of passionate teams embracing new ideas through our collaborative spirit. At PepsiCo, What Makes You Unique, Makes Us Better!
Functional Description:
Across PepsiCo, we continue to build new capabilities that will be critical to achieving long-term, sustainable growth. The operating environment in which we do business is undergoing immense change, and it’s imperative that we transform in ways that enable us to meet the future needs of our customers and consumers. Digital technology is one such force of change, and the way we interact with retailers, shoppers and consumers is evolving at a dramatic pace. The impact of Digital / eCommerce has fundamentally evolved and in some cases transformed almost every consumer segment with groceries / consumables being the next space that external experts and large players (e.g., Amazon, Walmart) are betting on. As a result, e-commerce is one of the fastest-growing areas within the consumer products industry and represents a significant opportunity to accelerate growth for PepsiCo going forward.
To ensure we win in this space we have established a dedicated eCommerce group, bringing together world class talent across F&B, digital, and key customers. While tied closely to broader PepsiCo, the eCommerce group has a unique start-up feel and defined values that embrace a more entrepreneurial mindset: bias for action; results oriented; community-focused; prioritization of people.
In order to maintain the necessary pace to meet the growth targets and compete effectively against start-ups or technology competitors requires a step-change in our thinking and traditional approaches to data science. Accordingly, this role will play a critical effort in shaping and executing the global eCommerce growth agenda through leveraging subject matter expertise in machine learning modeling and analysis. S/he will be tasked with partnering across the team to execute on growth opportunities and technical initiatives. Successful performance in the role is measured by quality and impact of this work.

Opportunities to propose new/incremental tasks to suit business use cases
Quick release cycle and managing the technical aspect of multiple projects simultaneously as they develop

Junior Data EngineerWarby Parker37 reviews-New York, NYWarby Parker37 reviewsRead what people are saying about working here.Warby Parker is looking for a motivated Junior Data Engineer to join our growing Technology team. In this role, you'll build out and maintain our data processing platform and reporting models used in key financial and accounting systems analysis. Working closely with the Financial Planning and Accounting teams, as well as the Supply Chain team, you'll build and support critical data products that enable our company to grow and improve. If this sounds like the kind of work you'd thrive on, we'd love to hear from you!
What you'll do and what you'll learn:
Our Technology team uses a mix of experience and objective data analysis to constantly experiment and iterate. You'll practice this method alongside other experienced Data Engineers as you take technical ownership of the system that powers Warby Parker's understanding of accounting and inventory data.

Our team is about as collaborative and transparent as they come, so you'll also participate in code reviews to maintain high quality of code. (We're building our systems to last and to adapt!). Primarily, you'll use Python and SQL and you'll learn how to deploy your code continuously using Git. We are a cloud-native company and work with many cloud products (IaaS and SaaS) offered by Amazon Web Services. Using these services, you'll apply techniques that are scalable and help our tech-enabled business to focus on delivering value.

As a Junior Data Engineer, you'll collaborate with software engineers and analysts on the Accounting and Supply Chain teams to understand their needs, produce code to solve their reporting problems, and provide business intelligence in Looker. You'll learn how to model data with a high degree of accuracy that can be used by the Accounting teams. In time, you'll increase model intelligibility and improve data processing efficiency. You'll also support the Financial Accounting teams with audit activities, regular period-based analysis and closing activities, and new exploratory opportunities.
Who you are:A thoughtful, detail-oriented engineer who has worked with data for at least one year professionally
Backed by working experience with (or a thorough understanding of) accounting and inventory systems—or experience with corporate finance, planning, and analysis solutions
Well-versed in SQL and Python
Familiar with open-source ETL tools like Airflow, Luigi, or Talend, or with commercial systems like Informatica, SSIS, or DataStage
Experienced working on a major relational database management system—PostgreSQL (which we use), Oracle, or MySQL—and optimizing queries
Able to describe how a transactional data model is different from a reporting and analytics data model
An excellent communicator, especially when it comes to explaining technical approaches and solutions to business-oriented stakeholders
About us:Warby Parker was founded in 2010 with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in house, we're able to offer insanely high-quality eyewear at decidedly non-insane prices (i.e., from $95 with prescription lenses—a fraction of the going price!).

In the last eight years, we've grown to over 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, opened our first optical lab in upstate New York, and launched two of our own iOS apps. And for three years running, Fast Company has named us one of the world's most innovative companies.

We also hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. This means lots of different things, like operating carbon-neutrally and distributing a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair we sell. (We're big believers that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world.)

Of course, all work and no play makes an extremely dull office, and no one likes an extremely dull office. (We sure don't.) As an employee at Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, guest speakers, volunteering opportunities, and other brain- (and/or taste-bud-) stimulating activities. It also doesn't hurt that our team is just great company.
Some benefits and perks of working at Warby Parker:Health, vision, and dental insurance
Flexible "My Time" vacation policy
Retirement savings plan with a company match
Parental leave (non-birthing parents included)
Cell phone plan reimbursement
A health-and-wellness stipend
Free eyewear (plus discounts for friends and family)
And more (just ask!)

While PCI has a robust monitoring, evaluation, learning and research (MERL) team, applying approaches and techniques from data science will be a new discipline for PCI. The primary goal of this internship will be to apply data analysis and data science methodologies across datasets to generate new analyses, predictive models and learnings for PCI. The analysis will answer questions such as: what factors are likely to predict positive or negative results within a given type of programming (such as female economic empowerment, or HIV/AIDs prevention); what demographic and socioeconomic variables are common for participants who complete and succeed in a program; and, what types of interventions are likely to lead to the most impact. The intern will work with the MERL and technical units to identify research questions and related datasets to mine, develop and test hypotheses, and document the methodologies used and results.

Additional goals of the internship are to develop documentation and strategies around the future use of data science approaches across PCI and collaborate with the Director of Global Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on identifying opportunities for the future use of technology for data science, such as machine learning. The end result of the internship will be to deliver: 1) at least one research project; 2) documentation on what role data science, machine learning and AI can play at PCI, and what processes and infrastructure PCI needs to put in place; and 3) a presentation to the MERL team on research findings and recommendations for data science work.

Data science is the core around which Custora is built. The central value proposition of our product is that we provide e-commerce businesses the ability to:
organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door
The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

We place particular emphasis on providing a robust system of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.

On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
Specifically, we are looking for:
A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.
Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming

On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.
We’re 45 genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.
We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.

Job Description
Amazon's Personalization team owns recommending items to millions of customers, personalizing the Amazon.com website based on each customer's unique interests. We revolutionized e-commerce with features such as "Customers Who Bought This Also Bought" and "Recommended for You," and we continue to be at the forefront of innovation in this space. We rely heavily on experimentation for learning how best to serve our customers: when we launch something new, how do we know it's actually effective and makes the customer experience better, not worse? Developing evaluation techniques is just as important as the algorithmic development itself because otherwise we're flying blind.
The Personalization Analytics team is seeking a skilled and creative applied scientist to help us build the future of experimentation systems at Amazon.
About you:
You have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to make a big impact on Amazon and its customers. You enjoy enabling intelligent decisions in the face of real-world, noisy data, and have a bias for delivering simple solutions to complex problems. You're a scientist looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You're a thought leader and you demonstrate this by delivering solutions, not just by having ideas. You challenge yourself and others to come up with better solutions. You develop strong working relationships and thrive in a collaborative and friendly team environment.
About us together:
We're going to help Amazon innovate faster and smarter by designing and delivering the next generation of data analysis tools and visualizations. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly insurmountable challenges. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is better than each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.
We have decades of combined experience on the team in many areas of data science so it's a great environment in which to learn and grow. Many of us have university teaching experience and we're happy to teach. But, we're also like children playing at the edge of a vast unexplored territory; we have a lot to learn and we are all exploring together with a sense of awe and humility.Basic Qualifications
Advanced degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, or Machine Learning.Computer Science fundamentals in algorithm design, problem solving, and complexity analysis.Proficiency in at least one modern programming language such as Python or C/C++.Preferred Qualifications
Entrepreneurial spirit and passion for innovation and having a large impact.Experience building systems for large-scale data science.

Do you love numbers and want to use them for good? Do you love using data to find stories no one else is telling? Are you interested in connecting journalists and readers to make sense of complicated issues? Mother Jones is looking for a hardcore data nerd to illuminate some of today’s most complex and urgent stories, from disinformation to corruption and financial conflicts of interest.

You might be a journalist with a solid data-science background or a data scientist with journalism experience. Either way, you should be able to explain to an intelligent, but statistically untrained journalist (or reader) when you’d use a quantile regression or what’s the best (or worst) way to visualize a data set. You’re the kind of person who has opinions about pie charts; your idea of a good time is a morning spent exploring Google Public Data. At Mother Jones, you’ll have a chance to apply your data superpowers to everything from breaking stories and big investigations to the challenges of building a reader-supported journalism organization.

You’ll be working with editors, reporters, design and social experts, and our audience team, so passion for communicating with and educating non-numbers people on data issues is a must. A degree in statistics is helpful, but you can demonstrate your data prowess in other ways. Experience in a newsroom or comparable setting is a must.

This position can be based in Mother Jones’ offices in San Francisco, New York, or Washington, D.C.

Salary will be competitive and based on experience.

Mother Jones is a growing, reader-supported nonprofit news organization dedicated to in-depth and investigative coverage of big, newsworthy stories. We have editors who can shape your investigative projects into powerful narratives or help you get fast-moving stories out in minutes. Our deep social reach ensures that your work will be widely seen. Plus, Mother Jones has a healthy, diversified business model that keeps us independent and stable, and a management team that knows that hard work and driving ambition are not incompatible with sanity.

Mother Jones and its parent organization, the Foundation for National Progress, are committed to a diverse and welcoming workplace. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, veteran status, union activity, physical or mental disability, AIDS/HIV status, on-the-job injuries, age, or any status otherwise protected under applicable federal, state, or local laws.

To apply, please send us a résumé and a personalized cover letter outlining why you’re perfect for this job and vice versa. Email both documents to jobs@motherjones.com with “Data Scientist” as the subject line. No calls please.

Placing women’s rights at the centre of all its efforts, UN Women leads and coordinates the efforts of the United Nations system to ensure that commitments on gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into action throughout the world. UN Women provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member States’ priorities and efforts, building effective partnerships with civil society and other relevant actors.
UN Women and the ADB are collaborating to produce a regional flagship publication, “Benchmark Publication: Gender Equality and the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific”. The study aims to provide new evidence for monitoring the implementation of gender-related SDG goals, targets and indicators, as well as provide policy recommendations to help governments in the region improve gender statistics and equality outcomes by 2030. Data and statistics are important tools for devising policies to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment, assessing their impact, and ensuring accountability. At the international level there have been important advances in normative and technical standards related to gender statistics. At the regional level, the Benchmark Publication serves as a critical evidence-based policy advocacy tool to advance the strategic positioning of gender statistics as a key part of evidence-based policy-making for the next 15 years.
In this regard, rigorous evidence is integral to inform policy to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Benchmark Publication is expected to provide a snapshot of the current status (baseline) as well as concrete measurements of progress towards gender equality in relation to the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific region. Simultaneously, it aims to identify data gaps (in statistics) as well as provide a policy tool to help governments in the region to improve gender equality outcomes by 2030.

Overview
Who We Are
NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It’s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you’ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.
We’re probably a little more Valley than Beltway. Culture first. Service oriented, non-hierarchical, focused on the work, and less about process/ dress codes/ etc. We believe in giving back, too. For example, our founder leads a company trip every year to the Dominican Republic to build homes as part of Homes of Hope.
Responsibilities
Why We’re Both Here - The Work at Hand
One of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You’ll be an expert for clients, partnering closely with our team of Developers and Data Engineers to create robust machine learning solutions. You’ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, provide guidance on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise. We mostly focus on exploiting geospatial data of all types (because pictures and maps are fun!) with a sprinkling of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ve also got some really cool technology partners that add tools to your toolkit.
We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
Qualifications
Who You Are
Beyond the whole “this person is awesome and I love working with them” piece, there are a few core skills that will help you out here.
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data.
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics. We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets.

Solutions – You like working with customers to solve problems and identify opportunities in their security approach and implementation. You’ll define and deliver on-site technical engagements with partners and customers. This includes not only delivering custom solution engagements, but also participating in pre-sales on-site visits, understanding customer security and compliance requirements, evaluating their data and analytics readiness, and proposing and delivering packaged offerings.
Delivery - Lead the hands-on execution of customer engagements and internal builder projects. Customer engagements include migration of existing functionality, evolution of existing capabilities and process, and development of new applications using AWS cloud services.
Practice Development – Helping customers is our number one goal – but it’s not our only goal. With each engagement, you’re looking for ways to collect, capture, package and share your knowledge with new customers, partners, and AWS employees. You are a force-multiplier – developing tools, services, and new artifacts to help others build on the work you deliver.
Amazon aims to be the most customer centric company on earth. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers critical applications for hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.Basic Qualifications

Transfix is changing the way companies view their supply chain. We are an award winning, recognized market and technology leader in the full truckload (FTL) market, which is a $420 billion market each year in the U.S. alone. We eliminate waste and solve inefficiencies through a deep understanding of the dynamics that exist today for the world's leading shippers and the millions of carriers and drivers that move their goods. We identify blind spots where data can fundamentally transform the way shippers and carriers work together, and we reduce the amount of “empty miles” driven by truckers with algorithms that match freight with trucks based on location in realtime. Our solution yields significant savings for shippers and increased pay for truck drivers. Ultimately, our mission is simple: to improve the lives of both shippers and carriers by creating a more efficient, transparent platform by which a product can be moved from anywhere to everywhere at anytime.
The problems we solve everyday are real and require creativity, grit, and determination. The culture we're building is one where we challenge the norms of the industry. The team we have is built on the foundation of personal growth, collaboration and experimentation.
Launched in August 2013, we have raised $78.5M in capital and are backed by top VC firms in NYC and San Francisco including, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Canvas Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Corigin Ventures, Founder Collective and Bowery Capital. We are headquartered in New York City.
As a Transfix Data Scientist, you will implement machine learning models into critical business processes, forecast industry trends, and build data pipelines. The Data Science team works closely with engineers, pricing analysts, and the business intelligence team to complement qualitative knowledge of the freight industry with rigor and quantitative insights. We’re currently living in AWS infrastructure including SageMaker and Redshift. At Transfix, you will be expected to autonomously run your own projects, drive business impact, and be a domain expert for teams across the company.
What you'll do:
Develop and implement pricing strategies into our automated bidding processes
Build forecasting models for freight market pricing changes using industry indicators
Collaborate with our Sales, Operations, and Tech teams to provide analytic and machine learning support
Execute long-term modeling initiatives

Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community. Industry wide, we’ve seen Stories as a new sharing/consumption format rise. One of the top priorities for Facebook this year will be leaning into this trend and making sure that Facebook is a Stories first product. With this change means disrupting the existing ecosystem within Facebook; it means shifting people’s sharing behaviors to be more visual and less text-heavy; it means changing the way people consume content from their friends and family and moving away from a News Feed format; it’ll mean learning how to monetize this new format to mitigate expected revenue cannibalization from News Feed, etc. We need a Data Scientist who is capable of tackling all aspects of this problem. As Data Scientist on the team, you’ll be expected to stretch across growth, engagement, and monetization of Stories, and work with data scientists to help the company execute this major shift.
RESPONSIBILITIESUse existing insights, and develop an understanding agenda to unearth new ones, to drive the product strategyOwn all communications of insights to management in support of strategic decision-makingPartner with cross-functional teams to identify new opportunities requiring the use of modern analytical and modeling techniquesPlan, and be able to conduct as needed, end-to-end analyses, from data requirement gathering, to data processing and modelingOwn ongoing deliverables and communicationsWork with data engineers to architect data and modeling pipelines
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSMS degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., statistics, operations research, econometrics, computer science, applied mathematics, physics, electrical engineering, industrial engineering) or equivalent experience10+ years experience doing quantitative analysis or statistical modelingKnowledge of at least one modeling framework (e.g., SciKit Learn, TensorFlow, SAS, R, MATLAB)Experience influencing product strategy through data-centric presentations (to product, business, and other stakeholders)Knowledge in at least one of the following areas: predictive modeling, machine learning, experimentation methodsExperience extracting and manipulating large datasetsDevelopment experience in any scripting language (PHP, Python, Perl, etc.)

Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
Facebook tools serve communities in some of their moments of greatest need. When there is a terrorist attack, wildfire, hurricane, mudslide, or worse, Facebook Crisis Response enables the community to prepare, recover, and rebuild. These tools, including Safety Check, help people around the world connect with their loved ones and get the information and help they need. Building products for crises poses unique challenges. Facebook's tools need to adapt to different types of crises, varying severity, cultural contexts, and more. They also need to work fast and deploy automatically in the minutes following an incident. We need a Data Scientist who is capable of tackling all aspects of this problem and who will be integral to the development and evolution of the ways Facebook serves communities in crisis. We need someone who can help imagine new products, handle difficult measurement problems, and work with a diverse array of partners.

Data Scientist, Analytics - Sharing/EcosystemsFacebook369 reviews-Menlo Park, CAFacebook369 reviewsRead what people are saying about working here.Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.

At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community; the mission of the Sharing Organization at Facebook is to do just that. The Sharing Ecosystem team’s job is to step back, and tackle deep, challenging questions that'll help inform our understanding of sharing on Facebook and the barriers. Questions like: what’s driving the sharing decline on Facebook, how much of this is from competition, from increasing audience concerns, from politicization of Facebook and changes in sentiment and brand; how do we use our understanding of sharing drivers to make accurate, non-linear forecasts; we know women and children are most susceptible to harassment and bullying - how does this impact their propensity to share, how do we detect and mitigate this in the future? This team is unique in that it’s not directly tied to a product team, which provides the team with the space to dive deep into these topics. The ideal candidate is someone who is a deep systems thinker, and is someone who is looking for a role that is more research heavy.

An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workersBackground

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.

But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.

Our Team

We’re a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded, team of self-starters who show up every day for the same reason: to create an impact on the way the world innovates. Our aim this year at Brightidea is to make it our Best Year Ever and we plan to accomplish that through our creative, focused, ambitious, and humble approach to change the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone entering our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you can identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful than this could be the perfect team for you to add your contributions to and shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.

Attributes to success:
You’re a roll up your sleeves and jump right in kind of person
You believe that data science is a team sport

Familiarity in big data distributed processing frameworks, Hadoop MapReduce and Yarn, Apache Spark, Open-Source and Commercial distributions and Cloud-based services (AWS EMR, Azure HD Insight)
Strong coding proficiency in at least one common scripting or compiled programming language (Python, Java, and/or Scala a plus)
Proven excellence at formulating, understanding, and solving complex, non-routine problems
Hands-on attitude toward problem-solving, including a willingness to dig into terabytes of data and quickly construct tools or models
Aptitude for diving into learning new theory and new technology
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Ability to work in a highly interactive, collaborative, fluid environment
Experience with any of the following is a plus: generalized linear models, support vector machines, ensemble methods, tree based learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, contextual bandits, Bayesian inference, clustering, convex optimization, casual inference, experimental design, control theory, kernel smoothing, generalized additive models
More about you:You are able to communicate and debate ideas, objectives, requirements, and deadlines in a candid and respectful manner.
You like to get your hands dirty and dig into the data, but never lose sight of the big picture.
You care about solving big, systemic problems. You look beyond the surface to understand root causes so that you can build long-term solutions for the whole ecosystem

Learn. Teach. Build.
